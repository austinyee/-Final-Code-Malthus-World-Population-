# -Final-Code-Malthus-World-Population-
Code review intructions: 
First download both csv files labeled "africa-population 2.csv" & "north-america-population 2.csv"
Steps to properly download both csv files: 
1. Click on the one of the csv files on GitHub to see the data
2. Then click on "raw" and it should open a new tab with the raw data
3. Double tap on the file and click "save as" 
4. Save csv file by adding ".csv" to the end of "africa-population 2" 
5. Reapeat the same for "north-america-population 2.csv" 


After downloading both csv files, be sure to load them into your notebook along with the our final code repo document in the SAME file. 
Then the code should run through. 
Thank you
